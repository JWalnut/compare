Welcome!

"Compare" is a Python library intended to facilitate the clasification and comparison of various English documents, particularly
legal documents, by a computer.  Work was begun in the summer of 2016 by John Walnut, Tyrus Berry, and Lincoln Mullin.

"Compare" utilizes several other publicly available Python libraries including MatPlotLib for plotting, SciPy/NumPy for calculations
and linear algebra implementation, and Princeton University's WordNet for language processing.

"Compare" is a work in progress.  Check back regularly for updates!

Documentation for the library is available on the project's GitHub Pages site, at https://jwalnut.github.io/compare.
